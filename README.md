# Data-Analysis-Group

Hello,  
this is the github repo for the Data Analysis Group of the Data Science Association Munich.  
The goal of this group is to find and analyze interesting datasets in the style of the well known TidyTuesday series (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxKSauhOY4g&list=PL19ev-r1GBwkuyiwnxoHTRC8TTqP8OEi8). Since we don't want to discriminate based on programming preference you are obviously open to use whatever language/package combination you want :).
The current idea is for me to upload a dataset every ~2 months and for everyone who is interested to meet and discuss the dataset at the end of the period. To have a bit of incentive to work on the dataset and make nice visualisations, we want to have a voting process where the winner gets their solution uploaded on our website.
