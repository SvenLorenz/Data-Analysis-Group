Dataset on the Authoritarian Ruling Elite

Downloaded from https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/QZ9BSA on the 18.03.2021, authoritarian_rulers.csv is a merged and a little shrunk dataset of all of the datasets offered.

Possible Questions to explore:
  How long did the regimes last?
  Are there influences how long the regimes lasted in the personel they had?
  Etc. be creative, but remember that we are not political scientists, so don't overinterpret!

An explanation for the variables can be found in `ARED 1.1 codebook.pdf`.

Happy Coding! :)
